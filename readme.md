This project was built off the Three.js Starter, which I've included the readme from below.

I installed a ton of libraries and manually added modules trying to get gif exports working.  Naturally when I tried to strip out some unused stuff I managed to break things again, so I'd honestly recommend starting a new project with Three.js Starter and then add in as little of this as possible.  Good luck and please feel free to reach out with questions or suggestions!
